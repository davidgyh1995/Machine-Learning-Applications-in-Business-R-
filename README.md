# Machine-Learning-Applications-in-Business-R-

The goal of this project is to dig out the relationship between house complements and their sale prices in Ames, Lowa. The data set contains 2930 observations and a large number of explanatory variables in order to be able to predict the future housing prices in the nearby areas. This project not only focuses on predicting the future house prices but also to determine the variables that are causing increases in the final price while we do not really care much about them.
